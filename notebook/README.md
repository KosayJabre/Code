# Team Notebook

This is a team notebook for ICPC-style competitions.

## Philosophy

The main idea behind this notebook is "it's better have something than not".

Because of this:
- there is lots of code, including for relatively uncommon problems
- there is a mix of complicated and simple structures and techniques
- this notebook is far more compressed than most other notebooks
