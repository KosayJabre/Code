\textbf{Rosser's Theorem} states the $nth$ prime number is greater than $n * ln(n)$ for $n > 1$.

\textbf{Nicomachi's Theorem} states $1^3+2^3+...+n^3 = (1+2+...+n)^2$ and is equivalent to $(n \frac{n+1}{2})^2$.

\textbf{Lagrange's Four Square Theorem} states every natural number is the sum of the squares of four non-negative integers. This is a special case of the \textbf{Fermat Polygonal Number Theorem} where every positive integer is a sum of at most $n$ $s$-gonal numbers. The $nth$ $s$-gonal number $P(s,n) = (s-2)\frac{n(n-1)}{2}+n$
